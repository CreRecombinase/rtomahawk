# rtomahawk

This package provides native R-bindings for interfacing with
[Tomahawk](https://github.com/mklarqvist/tomahawk/) libraries and provides
additional graphical functionality. This means exposing most of the features and
flexibility of the C++ API while not sacrificing usability that R provides.
